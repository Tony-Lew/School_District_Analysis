# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project we gathered data from the PyCitySchool district containing fifteen different schools. We used Pandas to gather and create new data frames to show the average percentage of students who passed both math and reading. We also used the data to show what the school district was budgeting per student and the success or failure that came with it. During this analysis we discovered a need to take out a schoolâ€™s 9th grade reading and math scores. We successful accomplished this goal and updated the new results.


## Results

District summary change:

  - The percentage of Math decreased from 75% to 74.8%

  - The percentage of Reading decreased from 86% to 85.7

  - The overall passing decreased from 65% to 64.9%

School summary change:

  - Thomas High School's average Math score decreased from 83.42% to 83.35%
  - Thomas High School's average Reading score increased from 83.84% to 83.89%

How does replacing the ninth graders math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other school's.

  - Replacing Thomas High School's 9th grade scores had a minimal effect on the school district and no changes for other schools.

Replacing the ninth-grade scores affected the data:

  - The average math score went down from a 79% to 78.9%
  - The average reading score had no percivable change.
  - The Scores by school spending had no change but changed the $630-$644 passing percentage in all three categorys

 ## Summary
 So with this data change I can say that it had a minor change in most categorys. You would have to keep changing the code to drill into the more significant changes for the Thomas High school. Looking at these categorys I would recomend placing my children into a charter school.
