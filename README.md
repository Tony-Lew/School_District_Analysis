# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project we gathered data from the PyCitySchool district containing fifteen different schools. We used Pandas to gather and create new data frames to show the average percentage of students who passed both math and reading. We also used the data to show what the school district was budgeting per student and the success or failure that came with it. During this analysis we discovered a need to take out a schoolâ€™s 9th grade reading and math scores. We successful accomplished this goal and updated the new results.
